This repo contains a template to build your own podcast specific Alexa skill. Once setup, you will be able to find and play podcasts through your Echo with the following intents:

"Alexa, open episode lookup and find episode one hundred."
  "Tell me about the episode."
  "Play episode"

"Alexa, open episode lookup and find an episode about 'economics'."
  "Description."
  "Next Result."

"Alexa, open episode lookup and find last week's episode."
  "Play episode."

Using this template, a completed Alexa Skill function will be written with the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js.

The code will be hosted on AWS Lambda and deployed through the Alexa Skills Kit on the Amazon Developer Console.
