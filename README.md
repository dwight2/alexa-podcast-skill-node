## Overview
This repo contains a template to build your own podcast specific Alexa skill. Once setup, you will be able to find and play podcasts through your Echo with the following intents:

   > "Alexa, open episode lookup and find episode one hundred."
     > "Tell me about the episode."
     > "Play episode"

   > "Alexa, open episode lookup and find an episode about 'economics'."
     > "Description."
     > "Next Result."

   > "Alexa, open episode lookup and find last week's episode."
     > "Play episode."

## Tech Stack
This template uses the (Alexa Skills Kit SDK)[https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs] for Node.js.

The function will be hosted on (AWS Lambda)[https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/] and deployed through the Alexa Skills Kit on the Amazon Developer Console.

This Alexa Skill template is powered by the (audiosear.ch podcast API)[https://www.audiosear.ch/].
